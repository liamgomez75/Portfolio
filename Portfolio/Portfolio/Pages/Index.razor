<p>
	My name is Liam Gomez and I am programmer, avid player of video games, and a Dungeons & Dragons enthusiast. I love to solve problems, and programming is an ideal avenue to do just that. I got my B.S. in Computer Science from California State University San Marcos in 2022. I’ve worked on a number of project ranging from mobile apps to designing video games capable of measuring behavior for human neuroscience research. My origins in programming stem from coding Bukkit plugins for Minecraft, and as a hobby I continue to design and program games.
