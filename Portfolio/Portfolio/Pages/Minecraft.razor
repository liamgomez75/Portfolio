<h3>Minecraft Bukkit Plugins</h3>
<p>I’ve authored and contributed to a number of Minecraft Bukkit plugins in my early days of programming. If you want to check out my Bukkit Developer page you can find it <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/members/sigitalis/projects">here</a>.</p>
<p>Below you can check out some of these cool plugins that I’ve worked on!</p>

<h3>Chatblind</h3>
<p>
	This was my first ever plugin and I began development on it when I realized a very common problem with the way that Minecraft chat works. Whenever I was tabbed out of the game I realized that I would often miss messages from other players in my multiplayer servers. It was then that I came up with the genius solution of creating a pinging system for the chat. I built a plugin to send pings to people which would play sounds on their local client any time they received a mention.

<h3>ParkourRoll</h3>

<p>
	This plugin was created by me to give players the ability to perform “parkour rolls” often seen in freerunning or parkour in the real world. Essentially it is a fun and interactive way to reduce the fall damage that players receive in-game. The way the plugin works is by checking for the shift key being held down as the player is falling. If the shift key was held down then damage will be reduced or negated entirely depending on its configured falling height. I also implemented a leveling system for it to add even more fun into the mix!
